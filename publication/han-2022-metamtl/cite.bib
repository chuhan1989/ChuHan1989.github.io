abstract = {Cells/nuclei deliver massive information of microenvironment. An automatic nuclei segmentation approach can reduce pathologistsâ€™ workload and allow precise quantization of the microenvironment for biological and clinical researches. Existing deep learning models have achieved outstanding performance under the supervision of large amount of labeled data. However, when data from the unseen domain comes, we still have to prepare a certain degree of manual annotations for training for each domain. Unfortunately, obtaining histopathological annotations is extremely difficult. It is high expertise-dependent and time-consuming. In this paper, we attempt to build a generalized nuclei segmentation model with less data dependency and more generalizability. To this end, we propose a meta multi-task learning (Meta-MTL) model for nuclei segmentation which requires few training samples. A model-agnostic meta-learning is applied as the outer optimization algorithm for the segmentation model. We introduce a contour-aware multi-task learning model as the inner model. A feature fusion and interaction block (FFIB) is proposed to allow features communication across both tasks. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed Meta-MTL model can improve the model generalization and obtain a comparable performance with state-of-the-art models with fewer training samples. Our model can also perform fast adaptation on the unseen domain with only a few manual annotations. Code is available at https://github.com/ChuHan89/Meta-MTL4NucleiSegmentation}
